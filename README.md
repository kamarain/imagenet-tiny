ImageNet-tiny contains scripts to generate a "tiny" version of the ImageNet
Large Scale Visual Classification Challenge
(see http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/). Tiny in terms of image
sizes and number of classes. These scripts help to make more machine learning
classes oriented tiny challenges that can be solved during exercises by
machine learning students.
