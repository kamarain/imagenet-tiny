Please, note that these scripts are generated from the training
scrits in Caffe github package at caffe/examples/imagenet/ and require
that you first install caffe. Do not edit these files directly, but
first copy them without the .example suffix, just run:

  $ ../tools/checklocal.bash

Then you can edit paths etc. to correspond your file structure.
